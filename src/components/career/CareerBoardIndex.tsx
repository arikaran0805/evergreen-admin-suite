/**
 * Career Board Index - Redirect Component
 * 
 * Redirects users to the first course in their career path.
 * This component is rendered at /career-board/:careerId (index route).
 * 
 * LOADING CONTRACT:
 * - Uses ONLY useCareerBoard() context (single source of truth)
 * - isLoading true → show skeleton
 * - isReady true + career null → redirect to arcade (not found)
 * - careerCourses.length > 0 → redirect to first course
 * - careerCourses.length === 0 (confirmed) → redirect to arcade
