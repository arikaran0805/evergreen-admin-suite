/**
 * Career Board Routes
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURAL GUARANTEE:
 * - All routes under /career-board/:careerId/* use CareerBoardLayout
 * - CareerBoardLayout ALWAYS renders CareerScopedHeader
 * - No conditional header logic anywhere in this route tree
 * 
 * ROUTE STRUCTURE:
 * /career-board/:careerId → Redirects to first course in career
 * /career-board/:careerId/course/:courseSlug → Course detail within career context
 * /career-board/:careerId/course/:courseSlug/completed → Course completion within career context
 * 
 * WELCOME PAGE BEHAVIOR:
 * - First-time users see CareerWelcomePage (full-page, no shell)
 * - After dismissing welcome, users are redirected to first course
 * - Welcome page is handled by CareerBoardLayout
